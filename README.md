# Python to C++ Code Converter

## Overview
The **Python to C++ Code Converter** is a tool that converts Python code into equivalent C++ code. It simplifies the process of transitioning Python projects into C++ by providing a basic, automated translation of common Python constructs such as variables, loops, conditionals, classes, and functions into C++ syntax.

---

## Features
- **Variable Conversion**: Automatically detects Python variable declarations and converts them to appropriate C++ types.
- **Print Statements**: Translates Python's `print()` function to C++'s `std::cout` syntax.
- **Conditionals**: Converts `if`, `elif`, and `else` blocks to C++ syntax.
- **Loops**: Supports translation of Python's `for` and `while` loops.
- **Classes and Methods**: Handles basic class structures, methods, and inheritance.

## Requirements

### Dependencies
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Built-in `re` module for regular expressions

### Environment
- OS: Works on any system capable of running Python (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- Memory/Hardware: Standard computing device

---

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-to-cpp-converter.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd python-to-cpp-converter
   ```
3. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.

### Usage
1. Prepare your Python code file as input (e.g., `example.py`).
2. Run the Python-to-C++ conversion script:
   ```bash
   python converter.py
   ```
3. Paste or input your Python code when prompted. The program will output the equivalent C++ code.
4. Save the C++ code to a `.cpp` file for further use.

### Example
#### Input (Python Code):
```python
x = 42
print("Hello, World!")
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
```

#### Output (C++ Code):
```cpp
int x = 42;
std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
if (x > 10) {
    std::cout << "x is greater than 10" << std::endl;
}
```

## Project Structure
- `converter.py`: The main Python-to-C++ conversion script.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and usage guide.
- Example test files (optional): Sample Python scripts for testing.

---

## Limitations
- Does not handle external Python libraries or imports.
- Assumes valid Python syntax; invalid or complex Python constructs may result in errors.
- Limited type inference (e.g., assumes simple integer, float, or string types).
